Every  staff \nassociated  with our life is getting  digital.  Almost  every  \nsmartphone  has a smart  assistant  that can speak  and \ncommunicate  like a human.  Speech  recognition  is one of the \ntechnologies  used in those  smart  assistants.  Text-to-Speech  is \na part of speech  recognition.  Text-to-speech  (TTS)  is a natural  \nlanguage  modeling  approach  that converts  text units  into \nspeech  units  for audio  presentation.  There  are numerous  \ntechnologies  used in Text-to-Speech.  Many  programming  \nlanguages  are used in these  technologies.  Python,  a \nprogramming  language  mostly  used in Text-to-Speech  \ntechnology.  There  are many  Python  library  e.g gTTS,  pyttsx3,  \npaddlespeech.  But everyone's  performance  is not the same.  \nOur thesis  is about  measuring  the efficiency  of various   Text-\nto-Speech  technology  in various  aspects . \nI. How  to Works  TTS \nText-to-speech  converts  text into human -like speech,  along  \nwith the ability  to create  a unique,  custom  voice.   \nA. Type  of Voice:  \nStandard  voice  : Standard  voice  is the simplest  and most  \ncost-effective  type of voice.  In the past few years  standard  \nvoice  has improved  considerably  to provide  a human -like voice  in multiple  regional  dialects,  such as Hindi  or Irish \nEnglish.  Regional  dialects  provide  greater clarity  of \npronunciation  of region -specific  words  or phrases,  making  \nfor more  understandable  and accessible  accents.   \nNeural  Voice:  Neural  voice  is a new type of synthesized  \nspeech  that’s  nearly  indistinguishable  from  human  \nrecordings.  Powered  by deep  neural  networks,  neural  voices  \nsound  more  natural  than standard  voices  by producing  \nhuman -like speech  patterns,  such as stress  and loudness  of \nindividual  words.  Because  of this human -like speech,  you \nend up with a more  precise  articulation  of words,  along  with \na significant  reduction  in listening  fatigue  when  users  \ninteract  with AI systems.  \nCustom  Neural  Voice:  Custom  neural  voice  uses your own \naudio  data to create  a one-of-a-kind customized  synthetic  \nvoice.  Custom  neural  voice  has the deepest  level  of voice \npersonalization,  with realistic  speech  that can be used to \nrepresent  brands,  personify  machines,  and allow  users  to \ninteract  with applications  conversationally.   \nB. Some  Terminology   \nPhoneme:  A phoneme  is the smallest  unit of sound  that \nmakes  a word’s  pronunciation  and meaning  different  from  \nanother  word.  \nProsody:  The patterns  of rhythm  and sound  used in poetry.   \nMel-spectrogram:  It is derived  by applying  a non-linear  \ntransformation  to the frequency  axis of short -time Fourier  \ntransform  (STFT)  of audio,  to reduce  the dimensionality.  It \nemphasizes  details  in low frequencies  which  are very \nimportant  to distinguish  speech  and de-emphasizes  details  in \nhigh frequencies  which  usually  are noise.  \nText -To-Speech  (TTS)  Structure  \n \n \nFig. 1 : Text-to-speech  structure  \n \n This is a high-level  diagram  of different  components  used in \nthe TTS system.  The input  to our model  is text, which  passes  \nthrough  several  blocks  and eventually  is converted  to audio.   \n \nPreproces sor \n \n● Tokenize : Tokenize  a sentence  into words  \n● Phonemes/Pronunciation:  It breaks  input  text into \nphonemes,  based  on their pronunciation.  For \nexample,  “Hello,  Have  a good  day”  converts  to HH \nAH0  L OW1,  HH AE1 V AH0  G UH1  D D EY1.  \n● Phoneme  duration:  Represents  the total time taken  \nby each phoneme  in the audio.  \n● Pitch : Key feature  to convey  emotions,  it greatly  \naffects  the speech  prosody.  \n● Energy : Indicates  frame -level  magnitude  of mel-\nspectrograms  and directly  affects  the volume  and \nprosody  of speech.  \nThe Linguistic  feature  only contains  phonemes.  Energy,  \npitch,  and duration  are actually  used to train the energy  \npredictor,  the pitch  predictor,  and the duration  predictor  \nrespectively  which  are used by the model  to get a more  natural  \noutput.  \n \n \nEncoder  \n \n \n \nThe encoder  inputs  Linguistic  features  (Phonemes)  and \noutputs  an n-dimensional  embedding.  This embedding  \nbetween  the encoder  and decoder  is known  as the latent  \nfeature.  Latent  features  are crucial  because,  other  features  like \nspeaker  embedding  are concat enated  with these  and passed  to \nthe decoder.  Furthermore,  the latent  features  are also used for \nthe prediction  of energy,  pitch,  and duration  which  in turn \nplay a crucial  role in controlling  the naturalness  of the audio.  \n \nDecoder   \nThe decoder  is used to convert  information  embedded  in the \nLatent  processed  feature  to the Acoustic  feature  i.e. Mel-\nspectrogram.  \n \nVocoder  \n \nIt converts  the Acoustic  feature  (Mel -spectrogram)  to \nwaveform  output  (audio).  It can be done  using  a mathematical  \nmodel  like Griffin  Lim or we can also train a neural  network  \nto learn  the mapping  from  mel-spectrogram  to waveforms.  In \nreality,  learning -based  methods  usually  outperform  the \nGriffin  Lim method.  \n \nSo instead  of directly  predicting  waveform  using  the decoder,  \nwe split this complex  and sophisticated  task into two stages,  \nfirst predicting  mel-spectrogram  from  Latent  processed  \nfeatures  and then generating  audio  using  mel-spectrogram.  \n  \nLITERATURE  REVIEW  \nDesigning  an effective  text-to-speech  synthesis  system  is \nquite  difficult.  Building  a whole  TTS system  requires  \ncompleting  several  steps,  including  normalizing  text, \nconverting  text to phonemes,  identifying  prosodic  emotional  \ncontent,  and generating  speec h. \nSpeech  synthesis  for different  languages  has already  been  the \nsubject  of many  research  proposals.  Before  electronic  signal  \nprocessing  was invented,  some  early  scientists  tried to make  \nmachines  that could  mimic  human  speech.  \n \nA Unit Selection  approach  for the text-to-speech  synthesis  \nusing  Syllabic  was presented  in [1]. In this paper,  They  select  \nsyllables  as their unit- hence  this was the first syllable  based  \nText to Speech  conversion  system  for Bangla  language.  In \nthis System,  It is necessary  to conduct  a substantial  amount  of \ntesting  with an even  larger  text corpus  than the one they \nutilized  as an experimental  text corpus.  \n \nThe research  by F. Alam  and colleagues  resulted  in the \ndevelopment  of a speech  synthesizer  for the Bangla  \nlanguage[2,3].  The diphon e concatenation  method  was used \n \n to make  this system.  It needs  a dictionary  that tells it how to \nsay words  so that it can talk. There  are 93000  entries  in the \ndictionary  [3]. The proposed  system  makes  voice  data for a \nfestival  and adds support  for the Bangl a language  to the \nfestival  using  its embedded  scheme  scripting  interface.  It \nturns  Bangla  Unicode  text into ASCII  text based  on the \nBangla  phone  set. But there  is no explanation  of how the \nprocess  of transliteration  works.  Also,  there  is no information  \nabout how the letter -to-sound  (LTS)  rules  for words  that aren't \nin the lexicon  were  made.  \n \nIn [4], the author  showed  how a Bangla  Text-to-Speech  (TTS)  \nsystem  was designed  and built from  the raw level  without  \nusing  third -party  speech  synthesis  tools.  For build ing the \nsystem,  they were  looked  at from  two different  angles:  one \nbased  on phonemes  and the other  on syllables.This  study  was \nconducted  on a very raw level,  and the researchers  used \nrecordings  of their own voices  to produce  phonemes  and \nsyllables.  The syllable -based  method  showed  higher  quality  \nspeech  than the phoneme -based  method.  But, limited  syllable  \nand phoneme  data were  used for the development  process.  \nIn [5], the author  used a concatenative  synthesis  technique  to \nmake  the system's  speech  sound  natur al.In this paper,  They  \nproposed  a system  that converted  Bangla  text to Romanized  \ntext based  on Bangla  graphemes  set and by developing  a \nbunch  of romanization  rules.They  used the MBROLA  \ndiphone  database  and did not develop  their own \ndatabase.Also,  The sound  quality  is not particular ly natural  in \nits presentation.  \n \nIn [6], they present  FastPitch,  a fully -parallel  text-to-speech  \nmodel  based  on FastSpeech,  conditioned  on fundamental  \nfrequency  contours.  Pitch  contours  are predicted  by the model  \nduring  inference.  The generated  speech  can be made  more  \nexpressive,  better  match  the meaning  of the utterance,  and \nultimately  more  interesting  to the audience  by changing  these  \npredictions.  \n \nIn [7], the authors  of the paper  propose  LightSpeech,  which  \nleverages  neural  archi tecture  search  (NAS)  to automatically  \ndesign  more  lightweight  and efficient  models  based  on \nFastSpeech.  They  meticulously  developed  a fresh  search  \nspace  that includes  a variety  of lightweight  and potentially  \nefficient  architectures  after thoroughly  profili ng the \ncomponents  of the current  FastSpeech  model.  Then,  within  \nthe search  space,  NAS  is used to automatically  find well-\nperforming  architectures.  The model  developed  by their \nmethod,  according  to experiments,  achieved  a 15x model  \ncompression  ratio and a 6.5x inference  speedup  on the CPU  \nwhile  maintain ing a comparable  voice  quality.  \n \nIn [8], the authors  made  a rule-based  system  for normalizing  \nBangla  text instead  of a decision  tree and a decision  list for \nambiguous  tokens.In  this paper,  a lexical  analyzer  was \ndeveloped  to tokenize  each NSW(Non  Standard  Words)  by \nusing  a regular  expression  and the tool JFlex[9].  This was \ndone  based  on semiotic  classes.  The main  thing  that the work  was that it was done  in sequences  of tokenization,  token  \nclassification,  token  sense  disambiguation,  and standard  word  \ngeneration.  This work  will be useful  in the future  because  it \ncombines  TTS and Speech  Recognition  and compares  the \nways  that rule-based  systems  and other  classific ation  systems  \nhandle  ambiguity.  \n \nIn[10],The  authors  developed  an audio  programming  tool for \nblind  and vision -impaired  people  to learn  programming  that \nis based  on text-to-speech  technology.  In this paper,  they \ndemonstrate  how users  who use the tool can edit programs,  \ncompile,  debug,  and run them.  The authors  mentioned  that \nthese  levels  can all be voiced.  As a programming  language,  \nthey use C# for evaluation,  and VisualStudio.NET  is used to \ncreate  the tool. Evaluations  have  demonstrated  that the \nprogramming  tool can support  the implementation  of software  \nappli cations  by blind  and vision -impaired  individuals  and the \nachievement  of equality  of access  and opportunity  in \ninformation  technology  education.  To communicate  with a \ncomputer,  vision -impaired  people  liked  to use mouse  events  \nand blind  people  liked  to use keyboards  with shortcut  keys \ndefined  in JAWS.  This means  there’s  not any inbuilt  or \nintuitive  systematic  approach  to handle  the interaction  with \ncomputers.  \n \nA diphone -based  concatenative  technique  was utilized  by the \nauthors  in the development  of a speech  synthesizer  for the \nBangla  language  [11].In  addition  to this unique  collection  of \nwords,  the tokenization  of null-modified  characters  has been  \npresented  in this study.  This is an important  and, to put it \nmildly,  a tough  task for a text-to-speech  program  (TTS). \n \nFrom  the perception  of the authors,  despite  the fact that over \n1.6 billion  Muslims  live in the world  and that Arabic  is spoken  \nby millions  of people  as an official  language  in 24 different  \nnations,  it has received  less attention  than other  languages  \n[12]. These  considerations  highlight  the necessity,  from  the \npoint  of view  of the authors,  for an Arabic  TTS that could  be \nof the highest  quality,  be lightweight,  and be absolutely  free. \nA rule-based  system  with an exception  dictionary  for words  \nthat don't  follow  the letter -to-phoneme  rules  might  be a much  \nmore  sensible  approach  since  the vowelized  written  text of \nArabic  bears  the pronunciation  rules  with few exceptions  \nfrom  their perspective.  This study  developed  a rule-based  \ntext-to-speech  hybrid  synthesis  system  that combined  formant  \nand concatenation  approaches  to produce  speech  that sounds  \nnatural  enough.  But for the lack of significant  stressed  \nsyllables  and intonation,  the overall  system  might  not perform  \nintuitively  as well as handle  the differentiati on in different  \narabic  accents.  \n \n \nCONCLUSION  AND  FUTURE  DIRECTION  \nThis review -based  study  has examined  different  Text-to-\nSpeech  (TTS)  technologies  and highlighted  their advantages  \nand limitations.  The study  has provided  an overview  of the  \n basic  functionalities  of TTS systems  and has shown  how they \nhave  evolved  over time,  from  rule-based  systems  to neural -\nbased  models.  The study  has also explored  the impact  of TTS \non different  industries,  including  education,  entertainment,  \nand healthcare.  One of the key findings  of this study  is that \nthe recent  advancements  in deep  learning  have  significantly  \nimproved  the quality  of TTS systems.  However,  there  are still \nseveral  challenges  that need  to be addressed,  such as the lack \nof emotional  expressiveness  and naturalness  in synthesized  \nspeech,  which  can affect  the user experience.  In terms  of \nfuture  directions,  further  research  is needed  to improve  the \nperformance  of TTS systems  in terms  of naturalness,  \nexpressiveness,  and intonation.  This can be achieved  by \ndeveloping  more  advanced  algorithms  that can capture  the \nnuances  of human  speech  and emotions.  Additionally,  more  \nstudies  are needed  to evaluate  the effectiveness  of TTS in \nvarious  applications,  such as language  learning  and speech  \ntherapy.  Overall,  TTS technology  has the potential  to \nrevolutionize  the way we communicate  and interact  with \nmachines.  As the technology  continues  to evolve,  it will \nbecome  increasingly  important  to address  the limitations  and \nchallenges  of TTS to ensure  that it can be used to its full \npotential.  \nREFERENCES  \n[1] Sadeque,  F.
